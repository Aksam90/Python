# File Read & Write Challenge

# Step 1: Read from the original file
with open("original.txt", "r") as infile:
    content = infile.read()

# Step 2: Modify the content (e.g., convert to uppercase)
modified_content = content.upper()

# Step 3: Write the modified content to a new file
with open("modified.txt", "w") as outfile:
    outfile.write(modified_content)

print("File has been read, modified, and saved to 'modified.txt'")



# Error Handling Lab

filename = input("Enter the filename to read: ")

try:
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print("\n File content:\n")
        print(content)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
except PermissionError:
    print(f"Error: You do not have permission to read '{filename}'.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
